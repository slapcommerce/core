# SlapCommerce Source-Available License (No Managed Hosting) v1.0

**Copyright © 2025 Ryan Wible**

This is a source-available license and is **not** an OSI-approved open source license.

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the **“Software”**) to use, copy, modify, create derivative works of, and distribute the Software, subject to the following terms and conditions.

---

## 1. Definitions

For the purposes of this License:

- **“Derivative Work”** means any work based on or incorporating the Software, including modifications, extensions, translations, adaptations, combinations, or rebrands, in source or object code form.

- **“Managed Service”** means a service for third parties where:
  1. You (or someone on your behalf) run or host the Software or a Derivative Work on infrastructure you control or manage, **and**
  2. Third parties access or use the functionality of the Software or a Derivative Work over a network (for example, via a web interface or API), **and**
  3. The primary thing you are offering or selling is access to that hosted Software or Derivative Work (for example, as a subscription, plan, or “cloud” product), rather than custom services around it.

- **“Consulting Use”** means running or hosting the Software or a Derivative Work as part of one-off or ongoing consulting, agency, or integrator work for a specific client under an individually agreed engagement (for example, a contract or statement of work), where any hosting you provide is incidental to those services and is not marketed as a stand-alone SaaS or “managed hosting” product.

---

## 2. License Grant

Subject to your compliance with this License, you are granted a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to:

1. **Use and run** the Software and any Derivative Work, including in production, for your own business or for your clients.
2. **Copy and distribute** the Software and any Derivative Work.
3. **Modify** the Software and create Derivative Works.

All rights not expressly granted are reserved.

---

## 3. No Managed Hosting / No SaaS

### 3.1 Prohibited Managed Service

You **may not** offer, market, sell, or provide the Software or any Derivative Work as a **Managed Service**, whether or not you use the “SlapCommerce” name.

This includes (without limitation) offering “SlapCommerce Cloud”, “Hosted SlapCommerce”, or any multi-tenant or single-tenant SaaS platform where the main thing you sell is access to a hosted instance of the Software or a Derivative Work, via self-service signup, public pricing plans, or similar mechanisms.

For the avoidance of doubt, using the Software to operate your own online store, marketplace, or service where customers interact only with your offerings (and not to administer their own independent SlapCommerce instances) is not a Managed Service.

### 3.2 Agency, Consultancy, and Integrator Exception

You **may** host, operate, or manage the Software or a Derivative Work for specific clients as a **Consulting Use**, provided that:

- Each client relationship is individually negotiated (no generic self-service signup); and  
- You do not market or sell such hosting as a general-purpose SaaS, “cloud platform”, or managed SlapCommerce hosting product; and  
- Hosting is incidental to your broader consulting, design, development, integration, or maintenance services for that client.

---

## 4. Derivative Works and Forks

The restrictions in Section 3 apply equally to the Software and to **any** Derivative Work, whether rebranded, extended, combined with other software, or distributed under a different name.

You may not avoid the “no Managed Service” restriction by creating or using a Derivative Work.

---

## 5. Distribution and Attribution

If you distribute the Software or any Derivative Work, you must:

1. Include this License text and the above copyright notice in a reasonable manner (for example, in a `LICENSE` file or about screen); and  
2. License the Software and any Derivative Work you distribute under this same **SlapCommerce Source-Available License (No Managed Hosting)** (or a later version of it published by the copyright holder).

You may add additional terms and conditions for your own contributions or services, provided they do not conflict with this License and, in particular, do not weaken or remove the “no Managed Service” restriction in Section 3.

---

## 6. No Trademark Rights

This License does **not** grant any rights to use the “SlapCommerce” name, logo, or any related trademarks.

You may use the name “SlapCommerce” only for factual reference (for example, “Built with SlapCommerce”) and only in a way that does not suggest endorsement, sponsorship, or affiliation by the copyright holder.

Any broader trademark or branding use requires a separate written agreement.

---

## 7. Patents

Subject to your compliance with this License, the copyright holder grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under any of their patent claims that are necessarily infringed by the unmodified Software, solely to use, run, modify, and distribute the Software and Derivative Works as permitted by this License.

If you file or maintain a patent lawsuit or other patent enforcement action against the copyright holder alleging that the Software infringes your patent, your rights under this License (including this patent grant) terminate immediately.

---

## 8. Termination

If you breach this License, your rights under it automatically terminate.

If you stop the breach within 30 days of discovering it or being notified of it, your License may be automatically reinstated, unless and until the copyright holder expressly revokes it.

Termination of your rights does not terminate the rights of anyone who received the Software or a Derivative Work from you and who remains in compliance with this License.

---

## 9. Warranty Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU USE THE SOFTWARE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, OR DATA), EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER FOR ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THIS LICENSE WILL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (USD $100).
